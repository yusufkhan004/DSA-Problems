a = [1, 2] b = [3, 4, 5, 6]
d = 2
if a is shorter:
    divide b into bl and br also length shud be same as 'a'
    bl = [3, 4] br = [5, 6]
    swap a and br:
    ablbr -> brbla
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2]

d = 5
if a is longer:
    divide a into al and ar also length shud be same as 'b'
    a1 = [1]
